# Newchunks addon for meteor client

This is my fork of [Staid's newchunks mod](https://github.com/StaidChannel708/newchunks). It's updated to minecraft version 1.20.4.

This addon adds newchunks to meteor client. i know meteor rejects already intergrated this module into meteor however that addon has lots of useless modules which slow down your game


### how to build

use ./gradlew build
